![Spaceship Titanic Banner](https://github.com/RiddyMazumder/Spaceship-Titanic/blob/main/Pi7_GIF_CMP.gif)

## 🧑‍💻 Predicting Passenger Transportation to an Alternate Dimension

Welcome to the year **2912**, where data science is needed to solve a cosmic mystery 🌌  
This project is based on the official **Kaggle – Spaceship Titanic** competition.

The objective is to **predict which passengers were transported to an alternate dimension** after the Spaceship Titanic collided with a spacetime anomaly while traveling to distant exoplanets.

## 🛰️ Problem Description

The **Spaceship Titanic** was an interstellar passenger liner launched with nearly **13,000 passengers**, transporting emigrants from our solar system to **three newly habitable exoplanets**.

While rounding **Alpha Centauri**, the ship collided with a hidden spacetime anomaly inside a dust cloud.  
Although the ship remained intact, **almost half of the passengers were transported to an alternate dimension**.

🧠 Your mission is to analyze the recovered data and **predict which passengers were affected**, helping rescue crews retrieve them and change history.
